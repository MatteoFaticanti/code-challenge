# Exercise 3

The cronjob command is the following `0 23 * * 0 /INSERT_PATH/backup.sh`  
The commands inside the backup.sh file will be launched at the 23.00 of each sunday.  
Backup .sh is composed by two commands, the first to zip the content of the /home/user folder and the second one to send using scp the archive to the remote server.
```
tar -zcvf directory-backup.tar.gz /home/user
scp directory-backup.tar.gz user@192.168.1.100:home/user/directory-backup.tar.gz
```
